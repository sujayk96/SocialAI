2,2023-04-26 15:38:29,clouddude444,Can someone say hi I am having a bad episode,I’m so alone and depressed I had therapy today and I was feeling iffy after that then I talked to my “friend” who only made me feel worse and just reminded me of how I really have no friends. I’m on apps trying to make friends but I just feel so defeated and numb like I just want to cry I want to scream I feel horrible and can’t get over it today. I have no one can someone please tell me what positive thing or actually not even positive just something they did today. I tried to get myself feeling better by making homemade gnocchi. I don’t feel any better just as bad but now I’m tired from doing all the work and cleaning up. Cooking used to be my escape and now I can’t even enjoy that. My mom just looks at me and I feel bad knowing she’s disappointed or not happy bc of how depressed and mentally ill I am. I am in so much pain and nothing I do helps. This is literally a cry for help like I don’t even know what to do anymore like I can’t breathe and feel very overwhelmed right now I don’t know what to do please can someone talk to me,110,76

Been feeling pretty shitty since I woke up today, for no particular reason, I just feel really sad again. I guess that’s depression for you. I just feel so defeated and hopeless.

6,2022-07-11 09:27:14,Over-Complaint-1350,"Um.. hi (I don’t expect anyone to read this, but..)","So.. it’s 2am on a school night, but honestly, I don’t think I’ll end up going today.

Last year I ended up missing 6 months of school.

My father was only mad at me, he has anger issues. I kind of hate him but he isn’t the point of this post.

I’m only 16, but I really worry about my future. My attendance at school is pretty terrible, and even though I got the best marks in English and psychology last term, this term I’m assuming I’ve failed most of my classes.

I told my boyfriend (yes, I’m gay) I’d be at school today. He’s really kind but I lie to him a lot like that.

I just can’t go. I had a break down just thinking about my teacher’s asking me why I didn’t hand in assignments and I’ve even started tearing up now at the thought of leaving the house.

It feels so terrible, like I can’t breathe, and I’m seeing a therapist for my anxiety and depression and since my 6 months of being absent from the world I’ve improved a lot, but lately I’ve gotten worse all over again.

I missed four weeks last term and I didn’t go to school yesterday which was the start of term 3.

I just feel like I can’t do it. I have high aspirations to become a police officer, and I’m currently doing legal studies at school, but at this point I feel like I’m going to fail school because of how absent I am, even though I know I’m capable of getting good grades.

I just keep feeling like I’ll fail school, and I won’t make it into any universities, and that even if I did I couldn’t afford it because I won’t get any scholarships and then I won’t get any good jobs and I don’t want to stay here with my father because he’s emotionally abusive and neglectful (and very homophobic, but that’s another story entirely).

I kept convincing myself that just one more absence won’t change much, because the times I do go to school I just read on my iPad and nothing gets done and it feels like a waste.

&#x200B;

And then I lose all my motivation for everything under the assumption that none of it matters because I’ll eventually kill myself once things get worse, (because at this rate it’s gonna get worse.)

  
The only reason I missed 6 months of school last year is because I tried to kill myself.

Only my father and therapist know. (Father is a douche, therapist is lovely.)

&#x200B;

I’ve decided to skip today because I’m in no condition to go to school, I can barely breathe as it is and I haven’t even stepped outside.

I feel a lot better knowing I’m going to be absent today, but I know it’s just a temporary solution.

What about tomorrow??

Am I just going to skip the whole week? Month?

&#x200B;

I just don’t know what to do at this point.

I‘ve always considered myself at least smart enough to get good grades, but I also feel like an idiot stuck in such a stupid loop.

I should just try harder, things will get better, I shouldn’t give up, nothing bad will happen when I go to school, it’ll be easier once I go and I’ll calm down, 

but dang it’s easier said than done.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant.

I should get some sleep.

&#x200B;

Thank you... for reading this, if you did.

&#x200B;

Sorry for wasting your time.

I’ll just.. try to get better, I don’t know.",248,51
7,2022-06-12 08:55:40,irinirinn,hi.,"I need suggestions.

What do you watch or do when youre depressed? 

Friends suggested movies or series , but I'm impatient for the plot and I can't keep my attention on it for long. Reading books is equally tiring too.

I'm of just sleeping and do nothing. But I find my usual hobbies boring. Normally I would bake, cycle, walk or cafe hopping. Now I don't any of the things interesting anymore. But I also don't wanna die like this. Help.",55,87
8,2012-06-14 02:11:04,another_sap,"Hi r/depression, let's make friends!","I have had this idea for while, we are here suffering for so many reasons or maybe no reason at all. But one of the thing is loneliness, frustration of having no one who could understand, relate to and care for us. 

After quite a few terrible things had happened to me recently, I just lost hope in people in real life. I think if there is a place where there can be someone who could understand, relate to people like us, it'd be this subreddit. So, why don't we make friends here? I'm fully aware we're a depressed mobs and sometimes two depressed person can't help each other. What if I can't/don't make another person feel any better? But well, if life is so shitty now anyway, what else do we have to lose?

Let's start by commenting on this thread to show you're interested. Just write a bit information about yourself, then PM other commentors, whoever you like, talk, and make friends. Let's try actively seeking out for friends and for something more than just a once-off off-my-chest chat.


Let me start, I'm a guy, 25, socially awkward penguin (social anxiety).

**EDIT 1:** More about me: I'm in Melbourne, Australia. I'm a web programmer. I started to have a slight interest in psychology lately, given how much stuff's been going in my head all these years. 

I like to think I'm the male version of Amelie in the movie Amelie, or The Fox character in The Little Prince (this (being like The Fox) is not my original idea, I saw someone else described themselves that way), or Mr. Darcy (without being rich or handsome- just the awkwardness and being misunderstood part I guess). And sometimes, I'm just a DOG.

I play Starcraft 2 a bit, not very good (Silver league), I'm not very competitive by nature.


**EDIT 2:** I hope you all make some friends. The most important thing is keep it going, don't stop after one chat, some of us are very sensitive.., of course unless it really did not go well.

I thought of doing this in a more organised way.. but let's see how you guy like this idea.

**EDIT 3** Thank everyone for your interest. As this thread is getting long. We're thinking if we should start a new subreddit.. Well, I actually like the coziness and moodiness of r/depression as it reminds us to treat each other  first as friend and with extra care. I wouldn't want this to turn into like r/r4r or r/4everalonedating where it even feels more alone. Also, this has been great but I don't know how long our interest will last. So I like to keep it small and slow for now. If we do start a subreddit, we need a strict guideline and proper dedicated mod. If any of you feel you are up to it, feel free to start one.

**EDIT 4:** This is the internet so please do exercise caution when making friends with strangers. Hope you all have some fun. 

**EDIT 5:** Many of you like having a group rather than just 1:1 and do Skype Group or video chat. By all means, please do, mention it in your post, make an bold **EDIT** if you have posted already.

And, unless you have already made too many awesome friends, come back to check out the new comers.

**EDIT 6:** This thread is about 1 day old, seems like it's slowing down and is about to die. To liven thing up, IF YOU FEEL LIKE, let's add images and links to your post. Nice photos you took of ~~yourself~~ (I'm not sure about this), your pets, landscapes.. or artwork, anything cool you made and want to show off. Links to your blogs, music you created etc.

DON'T put up your photo with you in it if you are Ridiculously Photogenic Guy! You'd make everyone feel insecure! :)

**EDIT 7**: I subsequently started other threads like this:

9,2023-07-25 03:50:46,ChillDonnie,Hi,"I’m relatively new to Reddit, and honestly I don’t know where to turn so here goes. For a while now I’ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. I feel like I’m close to the edge and that it’s almost too late for me. I haven’t told anyone else this but I really wanted to get this off my chest and put it somewhere. I’m going to paste three different writings I’ve made that can better explain how I’m feeling than I can right now. Also I’m going to be replacing any names with a blank.

I feel like nothing, like less than nothing.
I’m thinking I could make these poems and write how I’m feeling. 
But it’s not helping. All I’m doing is writing down things that I’d never tell anyone.
I hate it and it fucking hurts man it does.
I can’t help but cry. I’m crying as I write this. I’m tired of hurting.
I want it all to go away.
I want to stop hurting. 
And what’s worse is that I can’t tell anyone anymore than what I’ve already told them. It’s like there’s so many different layers to it. 
Like I’ve only told people the tip of the iceberg, and I’m afraid if I tell them more, it’ll only ruin their life. They’d have to worry about coming to  my rescue because I’m so helpless. I’m so close to the edge, and I don’t know how much more I can take. I’d hate to leave behind everything and everyone I love. 
That would just be selfish. 
I want to push through it for them.
Because they’re worth it. 
They are my only reason.
They’re what keeps me going.
But I’m so tired of being miserable. I’m so tired of being alone. Alone with this. But I can’t tell anyone what’s really going on. I’m scared. I’m scared I’ll drive them away. Or make them worried about me. I’m scared of dying young. I don’t want to die but I don’t know another way to take the pain away.
I’m scared of dying or becoming numb. But at this point it feels like pick your poison.
It’s not even about the failures I’ve had. 
Honestly I’m just sad now.
I thought that once school was over….
I thought it would be gone. 
Oh my god it isn’t gone. Please go away. 
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out 
Get out
Get out.

Here I am.
Again.
Writing to no particular person for no particular purpose. 
Sitting in this empty room with nothing but a tv, my cat, and my thoughts.
It’s sort of become like an everyday routine now. 
I go through the day doing whatever. Then I come home. 
And when the lights go off and the house goes silent, I’m stuck here. Stuck in this empty room with nothing but this void. 
The void I have instead of a heart. 
It feels like torture. 
Being left alone to my thoughts.
To my misery.
To my loneliness.
I feel like I’m trapped in a state of limbo. 
I can’t decide if I want to tell everyone what’s REALLY going on.
Or if I want to just suffer in silence. 
Honestly it’s probably one of the hardest things to have to decide. 
To me it is.
If I tell everyone, I’m scared that they feel like they’ll have to drop everything and come to my rescue. “Oh look, _______ is going through something. Let’s ignore what we have going on and coddle him.” Like I’m some damsel in distress.
That’s not all though. I feel like I can’t even tell because I will:
A. Feel like I’m being a burden
B. Because everyone else is busy with their own lives to think about me
C. I’m not ready. I’m not strong enough.
Then on the other hand I don’t want to hold this in because I feel like it’s killing me. I feel like I’m suffering. Like I’m being tortured with my own mental state. 
I’m tired. 
And I don’t like it here. 
I wanna go home.

No one cares. No one actually cares.
If they did then why am I still alone? Why am I still hurting? 
Why do I feel like everyone’s abandoned me?
Why am I still there for others? Knowing I won’t receive that same concern. I’m done avoiding it. I’m done denying it. 
Everything would be so much better, so much easier….

If I was gone. There’s no need for me to be here anymore. I have no place in this world. At this point I feel like everything that’s holding me back isn’t working. I love my family dearly and it pains me that I contemplate leaving this world and them behind. 

But it hurts so bad. I’m so tired of the pain. I want it to stop. I want it to go away.",23,10

14,2023-08-11 20:37:38,Honey_Sunbud,Hi. I feel shitty but that's okay!,"Just wanted to post because honestly for me the toughest part about depression/depressive moments is holding it in sooo I'm posting. 

I'm hoping to do this whenever things get harder, but I don't want to annoy the community, so it'll just be in this thread here, occasional check-ins, statements, vents, whatever. Yeah I could have a diary but a diary still feels alone, it's not a community. So feel free to ignore this post, it's just free-ing to post it even if no one responds!

I am going to a psychiatrist tomorrow as I am going trough a very hard time in my life. My mother is severly sick with cancer and I am the only child it's really taken a toll on me and I decided I need professional help.
I also have no father and as mentioned no siblings.
I never struggled with depression before or have taken meds. I would just like to take some medication to navigate trough this horrendous period of my life with some help.
I am still pretty active and try to be in good shape. I am scared the antidepressants will make me gain weight. Is there any hope, advice, tips for me? I would not like to gain a ton of weight and be sluggish as my mother depends on me now completely.

Thank you so much in advance

23,2023-09-04 21:48:02,watermelon_warlord15,Hi guys :/ tl;dr at the bottom 👍,"Hey guys, I'm pretty new here. I've got a slough of mental disorders, all of which culminate in a deep depression (bpd, bipolar, adhd, aspergers, and ptsd) I work in fire and ems, I was undiagnosed for a long time, my dream job (military) was recently taken off the table for me due to those things, just all the good stuff. I'm sure you guys are familiar. But anyways, I turned 21 a few weeks ago and I just feel like a massive f*cking loser. My dodge charger keeps breaking, I drink a lot and don't really wanna stop (I know, my fault), I can't seem to move up in the world, no matter how I budget I'm out of money, no one calls me back for better jobs, no success. I'm just stuck. I went through all kinds of trauma on the fire dept. and ems and it all feels like it was for nothing. I moved to a different area but now my ems job is just interfacility transports, so im literally the bottom-bottom of the totem pole where I work. I used to do semi badass stuff and now I just go to stubbed toenails at 3 a.m.(the imposter syndrome is killer). I'm just at a loss. Definitely not my lowest, but its getting there. I have lots of reasons to keep going, I have a wonderful and supportive gf, but I just feel like a burden. Sure, my car is nice and it drives, but its expensive to repair. Im just losing my mind rn. If im not sad, I'm angry, and if I'm not angry I'm in a state of numbness. I just want to leave it all behind and become homeless, or take a major risk with the delusion of blowing up and becoming wildly successful, or simply just ending the whole game. This isn't my first rodeo, but I just feel like again, I've reached my wits end. TL;DR I'm super depressed again, I see no end in sight. What do?",1,0

It was a long time coming we dated for 4 months but after the 3rd month I learned the hard way the honey moon faze doesn't last forever. Katie was so beautiful still is so independent and and strong and I guess in a way being my first proper relationship I wanted to feel loved and wanted all time time cause I hated being alone and unwanted so I was way to clingy.  We rushed into it but that 3 months was beautiful I want all that back . I loved her so much and she didn't see it because I was toxic and pushed her away she didn't end up loving me anymore . I want her back cause there only one woman I want and its her no one will ever look as beautiful in mh eyes as Katie.

He also has suffered 2 depressions in his life, both required hospitalization for brief stint.  Fyi, I look at depression like a broken bone, zero judgement.  I feel that’s important bc my family doesn’t like me talking about it due to shame. (So weird, bc zero chance they would judge others if they experienced it)

It’s been about 10 weeks since he quit and he is still very anxious and very depressed.  We are wondering if it’s dementia.   

Can anyone share there experiences after quitting both these things after using for so long?

Also, can anyone share there experience with Psilocybin as a possible medicine?

I haven’t been feeling like myself. 
Like the mask I’m wearing is getting heavier and heavier. 
I struggle to let people in, to trust people with my inner struggles. 
I feel so incredibly alone. 
My crying is out of control. I really can’t stop sometimes. 
Idk. I’m not a danger to myself, so I hope I don’t raise alarm. 
I’m just really struggling atm.
Struggling with feeling like a burden but also no one caring. 
I know this is just the ride we take with depression. We have our ups and our downs. I’m trying to ride this difficult wave out. It’s just hard.",1,1

35,2023-08-17 03:40:10,Steponikos,Hi everyone!,"
First of all I hope you all are doing good and if not, I hope that you will get better soon… 
Anyway, I decided to join this server couse I think I have been trapped inside some kind of depression. I have not been to doctor, so I might jusy be sad for no reason, but its slowly getting worse. Like I have been feeling bad last year and I have been thru a lot of shit, at least I think some of it “count”. Anyway, all the bad stuff passed away, and now I am literally amazing with no need to trouble myself. But I am not, day after day its getting worse and I feel more and more awfull. I do not think I can stand it anymore.

And I think thats it, I am pretty insecure, because a lot of people betrayed me (not only on the internet, but mostly in real life).
And I also do not want to trigger somebody by my shitty stuff and idk, just bother and annoy them.

If is someone interested I can tell them the whole story and what exactly happend.
Or If somebody would just mind to chat with me, I would appreciate that. 

Thats all from me, wish a good morning, oh and in case I do not see you good afternoon, good evening and good night.

Love you all!!!! <3",1,0

I am depressed and I hate myself. But dont worry, I am a spectrum of things. I also hate my family. Even through I know I am loved, i just hate it. And that shows how much of a crappy person I am. Things recently are getting better..well...Relatevly better. I am getting ready to move abroad..Not like I have anyone in country where I am staying right now but..I have this suffocating anxiety. I have been unstable for past few months. I honestly don't know why. I had huge moods swings from complete anger to peace or to numb or sad state. I don't feel like living or dying. But I feel bad. I just feel very very bad. I've probably hit my lowest at this point. But since I am not 6 feet below the ground..It seems I still have a way to go deeper. And that is what I want to avoid. While I was writing I've calmed down a bit. I am not sobbing like I was earlier. Even sitting and correcting non capital ""I""s. 
I just felt really lonely, sad, angry and very hopeless. I felt like dying but yet I was afraid to do so, scared of the pain. I feel like I am digging deeper hole for myself but I can't get out of it. I don't have courage to ask for help. Whose who are around me need help themselves. It's not the toughest period I had in my life but right now I am breaking down completely. I am not sure why tho.  
But really..Guys have a nice day and I am fricking sorry for a rant. And please..Ignore the grammar mistakes.",1,1

He is working now as a chef it is his dream job but now that he started, he says that he feels it's not for him or that he is not talented enough, every time he goes to work it starts to feel heavy, and every time he goes home all he can think about is he will just start the working again tomorrow. He is working for 5 months now. One time he said to me he wants to disappear go to a place where no one knows him and stay there for good. It kind of hurt because what about me? I'm here for him.

we've been together for 7 years now, and this time I feel like I don't know him, or why he is shutting me out. I just want to help; I even gave him space because he asks for it sometimes. I even sometimes plan activities that we can do something different from what we usually do like a trip to mountain, or any sceneries that's nature related. now I want to book a rage room.

but now i kind of feel like I am getting depressed as well because it feels like it's affecting our relationship. and i can't even tell him because he might think or feel that he is weighing me down. ",2,0

i have so much anxiety i do not talk even to my family which im supposed to be close to. this has given me self esteem and even more depression issues but the fact that im too scared to work is a problem, cuz then i hear like the beighbors doing sonething and then i want to do something, but im liwkey going insane and mute in the house and my parents are probably wondering why dont i talk to them, i am too nice to them now lol back then i wasnt when i had friends, now i feel like i have friends no one to share my thoughts to or anything so im going insane even writing this, it’s hard cuz i feel like im supposed to collect my memory from deep parts of my brain lol, i dont want to keep talking about depressing stuff but it’s all i know how to do, i need help. should i go to a mental facility again even though im scared shitless to go? Everyday my anxiety keeps getting worse, when I hear my brother talking I get mad. Also when I hear my dad or mom or neighbors. In the house it’s pretty quiet, so it doesn’t help that I get anxiety from it. But I can’t just leave? it’s all I know how to do and I want to leave so bad but I’m scared. Also I want to talk to my brother and it’s hard for me to talk to him like I’ll stand up and then sit back down and it’s a continuous thing of anxiety, everyday it’s like this. I’m going to college in fall so I’m scared that my anxiety will be all over the place since I have terrible anxiety from not talking to anyone or being scared to talk to them, pls help. I’ve always been sort of shy but now that I discovered my true self and have been my true personality to my family I feel like I’m gonna be scared to show my true self to ppl in college thus leaving me with no one to talk to and a big wave a depression and then I’ll kill my self like I always think of doing and then the cycle will keep going again. Did I forget to mention I withdrawed from the college two times lol💀 due to first burnout and bad grades and the second I dropped out cuz it’s a summer class but I need help I’m in my room rotting and I don’t want it to be like this haha. I should just go in my moms room and try to talk to her.",2,1
47,2023-06-30 07:49:46,SamGrilk,Hi,"Honestly, I don’t know what to think anymore, I thought I got close to people throughout school, now barely talk to any of them a year out of it 
Thought that I had a chance with some people, got close to a girl I work with, kissed, then ghosted me, now pretends nothing happened while still play flirting
Never been in a relationship or felt close to anyone really (besides the previously mentioned) 
Pressure of study by parents, always held to the bar set by my brothers

Truly though, I feel numb even with friends, only time I feel true happiness is when I’m drunk every other time feels like a mask  

Honestly I think I’ve made the promise to myself at this stage that if nothing gets better by the time my parents are gone, I’m following them, my mum is the only thing stopping me.

Love you all on this sub, I truly hope everything ends the way you deserve even if you don’t think you do ❤️",3,2

50,2023-07-04 17:30:52,No-Lack-5989,hi people!,"apologies for my bad english. im a 14 year old who speaks spanish

this shit gonna be long asf

ill be using this throwaway account as a diary. a bit of background info: i am M, almost 15, hispanic, struggling with dysthymia and passive (for now) suicidal thoughts.

my life doesn't suck if I'm being honest. my parents hate each other but they love me (they're split, i have a step mom and a 5 year old half brother), or at least they try to. 

my mom doesn't know how to love, she never payed attention to me and always allowed me to play with my ipad for 12 hours at a time. I played so much as a kid because I didn't want to hear the bullshit she had to say about my dad or how money was tight (I was fed frozen pasta at least 5 times a week when I was with her until she started buying decent food because she got a better job, and even that sucked).

 my dad, on the other hand, was overprotective and cared mostly about my grades and overall conduct. he cared about how I did, but mostly about how I performed as a person. he met his girlfriend a month after he left my mom and 2 years after they got married. she's alright, I honestly don't care about her. she's just really bitchy and overprotective when it comes to my little brother, she would choose him over me any day of the week.

about me, there's really not much to say. i enjoy mostly food, sleeping, reading comics and playing videogames, maybe drawing too (those last 3 only bring me slight joy for a while, then it gets boring). i am not good at anything. i mean it. i have tried a lot of things throughout my life, boxing, soccer, kung fu, swimming, and a few more but i ended up quitting them all due to my frustration or because i didn't enjoy it.  

i was born in spain but moved to argentina because my parents wanted to have a divorce. they spent 3-4 years fighting and screaming in front of me (i was 2-5 and constantly telling them to stop) until my dad had enough and left. 

for as long as i remember, i always went to the same school, where i had friends, but they always made fun of me or fought me. then i started primary school, and a new classmate joined the school. we became best friends but one day he started acting distant and said he didnt want to be my friend anymore. i was devastated, imagine a 6 year old not understanding why his best friend decided to not be his friend anymore. but then he said he would forgive me if i gave him my money and candies (there was a kiosk at the school). and this went on until 5th grade where he finally changed schools. he also did many more shitty stuff to me and my friends but its not really relevant. the thing is that's where my attachment issues started.

 i changed schools in 6th grade and the whole pandemic thing happened, i didn't go to school for a whole year because my parents were fighting the first few months over if i should change or not (my mother manipulated me into changing cuz it was cheaper). when they finally decided that i had to change schools, i isolated myself and didn't make any friends because i was embarrassed of showing myself or speaking during the zoom classes. 

7th grade started and here's where everything goes to absolute shit. i was 12 and was starting to experience new things such as interest in girls and insecurities because now i had to show my face. first day of school this super cute girl approaches me and asks if i was (my name), since she saw my profile on zoom meetings but had no idea who i was and i literally turned around and left since i was so ashamed of myself. the thing is she introduced me to her friend group and we eventually became best friends. i got to know her more and found out she was struggling with self harm, alcoholism, smoking, abuse (both physical and emotional) and suicidal thoughts. i was always there for her even when she cut herself and showed me, or that one time she told me she tried to kill herself by drowning. the last day of school she says she likes me. i say the same, because i really loved her and wanted to help her get over her stuff.

to make things fast, we dated for 4 months and she ended up being a fucking manipulative hysterical psychotic sociopathic slut, as much as a 13 year old girl can be. i was absolutely miserable when she left me, mostly because i was so attached. and once again i had to move schools because i was entering secondary school.

last year, 8th grade or 1st year, was absolute shit. i started cutting, choking and punching myself, suicidal thoughts, no energy at all, anhedonia and i hated everyone at school. i made a few friends the first days but then i got distant because i didn't want to get attached. i ended up in a psych ward after going to a psychiatrist (my parents found my cuts and bruises) and telling him i wanted to take my life. i was also diagnosed and medicated (dysthymia, risperidone and valproic acid). in the psych ward i met a few nice people who were similar to me and that got me kinda happy, knowing i was not alone. i got into comics, drawing and animation after i got out and with a bunch of help i made it through the year.

when i started 9th grade, i had a big friend group, interests, and i was back on track thanks to my meds, therapist and psychiatrist. they're all so nice! i met this girl and now im dating her, too. she's my best friend. 

but recently i started feeling down again, losing motivation and interests. music helps to cheer me up at times but not that much. i drag myself out of bed every day and go to school and feel miserable. i talk to my friends of course, they dont know any of this. i fall asleep in class due to the lack of energy. ive tried meds to help with this but none worked. i patiently wait for the time where i eat and then just listen to music in my completely dark room. its sad.

im seriously considering suicide. i want to escape this. i know im young, but this is something that will not stop, or at least not soon. and im not patient.

&#x200B;

tldr, life was okay, cant complain, these last 3 years were absolute dogshit and now i want to kill myself.

I am finally out of the daycare in that mental hospital for teens. I have, sort of, been thrown out.

I am now shoved into a new mental hospital where I will be for an entire year. I can go home every weekend but still, I am scared.

Besides my laptop is broken. I just wanted to replace the ram and put on new thermal paste but somehow the motherboard got fried. Acer wants to repair it for 1100 bucks which I am never able to pay. My phone is broken too. I have nothing left besides my oculus quest 2 in which I am writing this post now. Just everything I touch corrupts.

I am 35 years old, I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety at 19 and since then I have been on medication, both antidepressants and tranquilizers.

I can not anymore. I wake up so bad that I have to take half an orfidal pill to stop my tachycardia before even going into the bathroom to change or pee. Bad, I always feel bad.

I'm bad at work, I changed because I was very bad at the previous one, and I'm bad at the current one.

I have started drinking. To drink a lot. To get shots of rum around 12 or so that I can't take it anymore, to try to stop noticing myself as a useless fucking piece of shit.

Today it's not even 10 am and I've already had to take them, due to an argument I've had with my boss and 4 other co-workers.

I have a problem, and the problem is not that I need the alcohol. It is that I have been unable to know how to live with my anxiety, with other people. I have been unable to stop feeling unhappy, nor to survive with the pills that my dear doctor sent me. While life went by and the rest of the world lived their lives and set up their families, I have barely been able to hold a job without leaving my parents' house and becoming an alcoholic.

kid who got me  bullied a lot,I grew up with an alcoholic violent father and a hypercritical mother.I thought I got over my problems but I keep struggling with suicidal thoughts over  minor problems and when I have to make a decision and I feel like I didn t make the right one.Even tho I know that right now I have a good life,a job,some good oportunities I can t stop wishing I was dead if I make a mistake.I hate conflict so I try to be as gentle as possible so people will leave me alone but that s not the case.I wish I was stronger and be able to face the challenges life offers to me face on but it s so hard.I also have a pretty severe case of social anxiety and no matter how much I put myself out there I can t seem to escape it.I have to mention that I really do everything right,I have a routine,I work out a lot,I eat healthy,I take my vitamins and limit screen time in the hope that this would make my problems go away,taking care of myself but they don t even though I am pretty sure it helps a lot to not commit when I take care myself.I didn t go to therapy but I was to a doctor and they gave me some pills but those pills just made me sleep all day and when I didn t sleep just made me feel completely numb so I don t take them anymore.I rlly am a very ambitious person and I want to do so much with my life given the fact that I also have a big interest in academics,that made me escape de real world and hope for a better future  but because of my fear of confrontation and suicidal thoughts and the ability to not make decisions I feel traped and given the fact that I don t have solutions for that I want to give up completely.I truly feel like I am not strong enough to live.Sorry if I made mistakes,english is not my first language.If u can share some solutions I will be glad but at the same time even releasing some of this energy help cause I don t have someone to communicate my feelings with.",1,0

70,2023-05-21 07:01:43,garaltwitcher,Hi guys. My depression and anxiety is terrible for 2 reasons.,First reason is I drank alcohol which made things worse and the 2nd is I ran out of NY Valium for 4 days now and can't fill it for another 5 days.... what I'm feeling mentally is a nitrate I feel this dread and doom feeling and like I'm in a dream state. I've been mostly in bed soooo exhausted and fatigued from my nerves being on high alerta from withdrawal I guess it is....not alot helps. I've tried baths and breathing techniques etc. I might be able to get a family member to drop off a few Ativan. Just because I've told them how bad it is.  Intrusive thoughts and the constant anxiety is giving me chest pain and of course that sets off more anxiety because you worry it's a heart problem.

 There even have been some times when I was beaten by my parents for having low grades (in past 3 years), but what they didn't understand that i never cheat in exams and there are students in my class who cheated and gained marks better than me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

since my birth there has been nothing but suffering and stress, I was born prematurely with a prognosis of dying young and becoming a dwarf, in addition to having a weak immune system...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sadly, it was not like that. I am currently 19 years old and sadly I am about to turn 20... curious about the age at which my family can legally get rid of me and pretend that I never existed... good for them I suppose? .. or I guess it's better to put some context.

&#x200B;

I was born from an old-fashioned family in Venezuela... relatives with pseudo-stable jobs... a grandmother and grandfather who worked in the educational system, my ""mother"" worked for the state, and my ""father"" worked for the police if not bad I remember in a high position...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

now, what does that have to do with me... let's go back to my childhood, a 3-year-old, knowing how to speak, using a computer perfectly, in addition to having a very strong learning capacity, basically I could learn everything without problems but... only if it was of my interest My family lived it all my childhood, hit me for making a mistake, ""which is normal, isn't it?"" The difference is that I was born with Asperger's, sadly my family lived with the stigma that ""having Asperger's"" implies that if or if you will be someone successful and without mistakes... as if I were some kind of robot or something like that... We were like this for years, all the time I received insults and blows just because I was wrong. I was religious, ""I'm not saying it was as if I no longer believe in God or something like that, the truth is that I do believe"" but very different from others because I did have contact with He... not like many who read the Bible and because they feel a breeze or something like that they think they are talking to him... but this is not the case... not yet

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

During my childhood, due to the type of treatment I had, I developed a type of fascination or taste for hurting living beings or even animals. there were cases in which I ended up making a bonfire in the back of the house and burning cats just for fun... somehow I was always fascinated to see them writhe in pain... I really don't know what the hell was going on with me at that time ... when I was 9 years old, a relative of mine, exactly a cousin, sexually took advantage of me for at least 6 uninterrupted years, basically until I turned 15. She always went to my house, as my family was distracted or didn't care. to do. he took advantage of when we were alone to use me as a kind of human dildo for hours, then he left as if nothing had happened. ""As a result of this, I thought that some kind of STD might have hit me, since I currently have a type of wound in my crotch, it always secretes pus and it hurts... I've tried everything and it won't go away.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

oh.... and there are many things that I don't mention here but... it's what my damaged memory can remember... after all, I don't even remember when was the last birthday that I could look forward to.... or I even gladly wish it to arrive... Now, I suppose someone wondered why I mentioned that I had contact with God?... There was a day that I passed away from one moment to the next, or so it seemed... my body was like a stone They couldn't lift me because I was too heavy, besides I had no pulse or breathing... during that time that I supposedly wasn't there... somehow I ended up in some kind of garden... or something like that. .. animals that did not attack each other, despite being predators and prey... exactly an albino tiger. with eyes as blue as the sky, and a deer with a classic hue, but its antlers were very... angled?... I don't know, I barely managed to remember well, apart from the conversation... in fact, he would have told me that She was very sorry that I had finished being born... since she only had one, which was just my younger brother who was alive at that time, and I have to say that it was unbearable.... in many senses. in addition to offering me a peaceful death... in addition to warning me that all this was going to get worse... of course, I was an innocent boy who only thought of the positive despite seeing everything that was going to happen... alone... I rejected the proposal... and he ended up accepting it, in addition to telling me that I will always have a position there... it's the last thing I remember and I woke up or revived out of nowhere... as many would say...

&#x200B;

The truth is that I regret having rejected his proposal, my mother continued with her ""negligence"" as I wanted to tell her, making me go pick up what she needed, once risking almost being run over, and another time for just walking around wanting to relax my Mind you, I was almost shot by a neighbor who was robbed often, as I was a very clueless child, I hadn't heard anything, and since it was night and

&#x200B;

I have the body and height of an older teenager at 14, he thought I was a thief and he almost ended up shooting me... luckily nothing happened.

&#x200B;

then now we have to... due to many truamas both with the studies and with the jobs... now I am unable to look for my own job, just entering makes me think about all the bad things that can happen. either because of the verbal abuse by my family when I work for them, as well as what can happen to me outside of this since the last two times I worked.

&#x200B;

1: I fell from a roof and broke a rib... which I could never check and now I can't breathe well, and with pain in the left side of my chest, right where I hit

&#x200B;

2: a strong blow to the knee due to falling off the bus which abruptly jerked off as I got off the bus, causing all my weight to fall on the leg. ""exactly about 90 kg."" It lasted almost 9 weeks to recover, but trying to run now is painful for me ..

&#x200B;

And now to top it off they complain that I didn't study at the university because they want me to be a ""successful man"" according to them. which, despite now having money, prefer to boast about it, I started studying on an open campus... trying to learn programming since the universities where I live do not teach correctly, in addition to teaching you only the basics for those 5 years of studies What are you going to have... years where they will be robbing you without teaching you what you really need, now when I was studying that a campus ended up calling my attention... they hung up the internet making it impossible for me to continue my studies under the pretext of being an ""unnecessary expense"" "".. as well as spending on my health, which is bad due to my heart problems, and also a cerebral edema that I have which, despite not being visible, has harmed me since it is difficult for me to speak sometimes,

The truth is I just... I need help... or some advice... whatever helps me...",2,0

anyway hi. i'm in my late 20s. i've struggled with low self-esteem and depression since i was a child. i got a bachelors and a masters in music. i chose to study music because i didn't think i was capable of being good at any other skill. everything went ok when i was in undergrad, but by the end of undergrad i was kind of regretting my choice already. but i enrolled in my masters in music anyway, because it's just the thing to do in that field and i felt like i had no other career prospects. 

when i started the masters program, things really started to go south for me. i had to move away to a different city where i knew no one and was isolated from my friends. i tried maintaining my friendships but we drifted apart anyway. the grad school was way more competitive, and i let it get to me. i thought my advisor hated me because i was so incompetent. 

when covid hit i graduated and moved back home. i tried transitioning into a new field without getting a new degree. i was bad at entrepreneurship and self-study, and i haven't gotten much work experience. my parents hate me for not having a career, so i have no family to turn to for support.

i have tried hanging out with my friends now that i'm back in my home city, but everything feels different. we barely hang out like we used to, and when we do it's never for long enough to really talk about anything deep. it's much harder to be vulnerable. i don't even know if i can call them friends anymore. i desperately want to talk to them about my depression and suicidal thoughts but i don't know how to bring it up without freaking them out.

i'm thinking about applying for another masters in the field i want to transition too, because getting my foot in the door has been so hard, and i think i have to accept the fact that i am just the kind of person that needs structure to stay focused. i can barely think of anybody who can write my letters of recommendation, because they don't remember me, or the work i did for them wasn't that good. i'm feeling so much self-hatred. why why why didn't i choose the right degree the first time? who's to say it's the right choice this time? what if i STILL don't find work? 

and my poor boyfriend, who has been paying for my stuff all this time. i don't know why he's with me. he has such a nice salary and i'm just a deadweight who can't focus, can't be happy, just stupid, stupid, stupid! i should be grateful that i have so many good things going for me.",5,3

98,2012-03-08 23:55:35,Supora,Hi. Please don't downvote me.,"It's my birthday today...well it will be for the next twenty minutes...and the only thing I've done today is see my psychologist. None of my friends remembered it was my birthday. I know that's not something to be depressed over...I know. But I've been making a big deal out of it being my twenty-first and I would have hoped at least one of them wanted to show me they had thought of me. 

For a lot of people, their twenty-first birthday is really special and they go out and have their first legal drink with friends. But I'm at home, watching MST3K...and like every year, I've wasted my birthday. 

Last year I spent it in a hotel room, alone, after being kicked out of my apartment because the guy who I was living with had a crazy girlfriend who hated me because I wouldn't do everything she ordered me to do told him to kick me out or she would take his kids away.

The year before, I had no friends at all and spent it in my dorm room, listening to my neighbors party in their rooms with their friends.

I just wish I had a better personality so people weren't so turned off by me. I try so hard to be a good friend. But it's not enough if you're boring and, well, pretty dumb. 

What's more, I took one of my midterms yesterday and failed...again. After hours upon hours of hard work studying, I still failed. Everyone on the class's facebook page posted their wonderful grades and one guy even said that if you didn't pass, you should just drop the class, because you must be some sort of idiot.

Thanks for pointing it out, guy. It's not like I already didn't feel horrible.

I don't know what's wrong with me, and I doubt anything will come of this post. But I just wanted to get it in writing.

I know one of these days I'm going to take my life. I've accepted it. I know one of these days I'm going to cut myself again, and my boyfriend is going to leave me. It's pretty inevitable. 

It's clear I'm not smart enough to make it through college, and I don't have enough talent to make it in the career I want. I don't even have any work experience, so it's not like I could get a job at Wal Mart or anything.

I wish this would end.
I wish this would end.
I want it to be over.
Something.
Either my life, or how I feel.
Either one.
I wish there was a god, so I could beg it to take my life.
Or ask it to help me feel better, at least.

My head hurts from crying so much, and I woke up with my face all swollen and my eyes red and puffy from crying the day before. 

Make it stop.

The loneliness is unbearable. I am a loser. But what else is new?


I tried to get someone to talk to me today, on the internet. I posted on someone's ""cake day"" post, and I said it was my birthday as well. But all I got was downvoted.

How do they know I am so worthless? How is it that obvious? Can they tell just by looking at my username? All I said was that it was my birthday, too. 

I just want to stop hurting so much. Why do I have to have a sick brain? At least I could just be a not depressed loser. Maybe think I'm awesome, even though I'm not. At least I would be happy.


EDIT: My boyfriend made me leave the apartment and go have a birthday drink with him. It made me feel much better, but the replies made me even happier. I am so happy that people care...I just felt so empty and that no one, even on here, would reply.

I can't tell everyone how much better their replies made me feel. I cried from happiness just now, and I want everyone who replied to know that I appreciate them taking time out of their day to respond to me. Really...you have no idea how much better each reply made me feel.

Thank you...thank you all.",216,82
99,2023-01-31 03:36:31,bluehairbaddie,Hi. This is cross posted but I wanted to share this resource with everyone. I have never heard of it before.,"
My doctor told me about a program called “The Living Room” today. I now know they are all over Illinois but I can’t be certain about anywhere else. But it’s a walk-in thing. You just walk in and they have tvs and activities and stuff to do and provide snacks and such. I can’t guarantee all are like this but I imagine so. They have staff to talk to and recourses to get help and it’s supposed to just be a breath from society. Mine is open 8-8 but not sure about anywhere else. And on top of all of this (at least mine is I’d assume all are but check) it’s free whether you have insurance or not. I’m going tomorrow for the first time. I will update tomorrow on my experience. But I figured I’d share this. I’m on a waitlist to get therapy and go into a php program but this will be a nice in the meantime. I hope this helps at least one person. I was feeling lost and hopeless and this helps a lot. I hope it helps someone.❤️",4,0
100,2023-01-31 17:06:18,Throwyotraps,Came to say hi and get some poison out,"Depression has been my uninvited guest my entire life, but I did have a few years when I was truly happy and completely free from it. I told myself that I should remain present, enjoy every bit of it, and avoid worrying about it coming back. During those years, I wasn't in a great marriage, but I did truly love my husband and was studying Architecture and distance running and those two parts of my life were enough. 

Then my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer (glioblastoma). She went in for a biopsy shortly after she was diagnosed, and they hit a blood vessel in her brain and scrambled it like eggs trying to stop the bleed. When she woke up she could only speak and express her feelings like a 2 year old. She couldn't write or walk well or brush her teeth so I kind of lost her overnight. The cancer was aggressive, and it grew inside her brain and made it swell inside her skull. 8 months later she died the most agonizing death that I hope to ever witness. She died of the worst headache you could imagine. It was horrific. 

The hospice people tell you not to make any major life decisions until you've got at least a year of grieving under your belt, but I knew right after my mom's brain got fucked up that life is short and staying in a bad marriage is not a good way to spend it. I waited a year and even though I loved my husband and I was terrified to leave, I left. It's been 9 years since I left and it was the right thing to do for myself. 

I came back home and worked/saved until I could go to the local Architecture school. The environment at that school was toxic. I can't believe that the university was ok with them straight up abusing students, but I was the only person that seemed to have a problem with it. I'm too old for that shit and I'm good enough at abusing myself - I don't need help from anyone so I decided to phone it in and get a business degree. Even though I resisted winding up in a cubicle (that's why I didn't go to college until I was in my late 30s), I still wound up in a cubicle and I thought that I could handle it.

I'm now 41 and in a relationship with a man that I love very much, but I'm suffering again. No matter what, there is depression in my life. I'm able to hide and ignore it pretty well in the summer time, but the winters are almost unbearable. I'm ashamed of it. It's chronic and I don't think other people understand how impossible it is to get rid of. I feel pressure to control it and sometimes I am able to by eating right, exercising, and getting regular sleep, but it has gotten to the point this winter where I just had to surrender because discipline is impossible when you don't want it. I have just stopped caring, but I still feel like I have to hide what's happening. I work at a huge corporation in a job that pays well and sucks all the life energy I have out. I don't fit in there. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm required to go to the office 2 days per week, but I left after 2 hours today to work from home. 

My partner is a wildland fire fighter. He gets paid to work out for 2 hours a day and he seems to have a limitless font of energy. When I met him I was lifting weights and running regularly. He has always had some kind of criticism or unsolicited advice to give me about how I'm lifting or running or about how hard I'm trying. I've been very clear with him about why I want to work out - it's not about competing with anyone, it's about mental health and staying fit enough to do fun stuff like snowboarding and backpacking. Since I met him (about 3 years ago) I have been trying to be strong enough and fast enough for him, but it has taken all the joy out of exercise for me. I've become rebellious and have completely quit trying. I'm out of shape and my back hurts from sitting all day. I've been trying to set boundaries with him. I need respect and support, but if I can only have one of those things it has to be respect. We've been fightning and I hate it. 

I feel like it's damned near impossible to find joy. My heart is closed and I can't open it back up.

I was able to make myself go on a run this afternoon. I can't say that it made my depression go away, but I did it and that's something. I feel old, tired, and completely out of shape, but I did that. Aside from that little run, I'm in one-foot-in-front-of-the-other mode and shit is dark and I hope I can find my way out of this one soon...",1,0

104,2023-01-22 21:41:36,ItsCookieDay,Hi ! I’m new here 20 F and got diagnosed depressed over a year ago,"All my childhood long, it made me feel better to plan my future adult life. I had a really bad relationship with my dad (he left my mom and I (at age 7) after cheating on her for months which got us into serious debts) and I used to be emotionally harassed by my ex step mother and some of my peers in high school.

At 17, my dad finally started to actually act like a dad towards me. He started to come monthly to see me, made sure i was doing good and all. He even apologized for his absence and his lack of communication skills. We talked about what I had to cope with and it helped me cope with a very old wound he had created.

At 18, I’ve met my current boyfriend. He wasn’t like me at all and I tried to enter his world. I started partying and smoking hash after hanging out with stoners for months and months. For months, my boyfriend wouldn’t really make some efforts into our relationship but he actually changed his behavior after seeing my current state a couple months ago.

I feel really bad because last weekend I ruined everything I was trying to build.

I’m a student and studied really hard in order to get a good scholarship so that I could rent an appartment in Paris when I get to college, which was one of my dreams. A year later, It took several months to convince my boyfriend to come and live with me in Paris. I want to become totally independent from anyone so that I don’t cause any trouble and I’m not a burden, so I got this little student job as a babysitter, that didn’t pay that much but it did helped financially.

My boyfriend 22M, without being mean, is kind of the lazy type ? I mean if I don’t do thing he won’t do them, even when I remember him things for him he would forget and never do it even months after like redoing his ID after have it stolen in may 2022 (still not done).
He tried to find a job to help me pay for the bills at our appartment but sometimes he wouldn’t reply back to mails from comapines and wouldn’t show up to some job interviews. In 3 months, he had not find a job and my little wage, my scholarship wouldn’t be enough. 
I tried to keep on paying for the bills, the hash, the tabacco, the train trips, the food and everything for our two cats but I couldn’t no more and the constant pressure of not being able to pay the rent for a couple days or some really important bills broke me, I couldn’t fake being happy anymore and feel into a vicious circle in which I’d cry several times a day and would try to keep the secret from everyone except him.

We celebrated my birthday with my parents and at a moment I can’t explain why, I started a panic attack (the first time in front of my parents) and had to tell my parents that I was actually depressed but going to the psychiatrist was too expensive so I had stopped.

They talked to my boyfriend and I for hours and hours saying that we need to take a couple months at our parents to feel better and not stress over money and stuffs. But, now it means I have to ask the permission to my mom to sleep at my friends’, to party, to see my boyfriend, to go a couple days alone in my appartment, I feel really bad, without him and with the fact that we were building our life together and I ruined everything by telling my parents my problem. They already have financial problems I don’t want to be a burden, I feel like a failure. Now I have everything I wanted as a child : studies in Paris, my own appartment, a little job I love, a stable relationship with my current boyfriend, real good friends, a very good relationship with both my parents, good health. Why am I depressed then ?? 
Am I not trying enough ?

I tried to synthesize the more I could, sorry in advance to bother you guys and sorry I just feel deeply lonely and need some advice. Am I the biggest piece of sh** on this earth ? 

Have a good day !

Would someone be willing to talk for a bit to calm me down?- nvm I guess,"I'm trying to sleep and something really painful that I've tried really hard to forget keeps finding its way into my thoughts. For the first time in a while my heart feels like it's a furnace pumping a thick burning tar into my veins. I need someone to tell me that I did everything I could and that it isn't fault and that I need to keep my focus on the future and leave the past behind. I tried so fucking hard to help and it cost me everything. I've been trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered life, but if I can't move on and somehow make peace with what happened I'm going to... I can't go on like this. 

The sanctuary of my mind- it always finds its way in. It stands in the shadows by the door. When it enters the lights go dark and the air becomes heavy and cold. It stares into the back of my head until I turn to face it. It's me. Me as I am now. The me that I hardly recognize. The face is much the same, but the eyes... the eyes are like the bottom of an ocean, the cold and the dark seem to go on forever, the most terrifying things lurk in that darkness. it's too vast. too deep. I know I can't get out. there's no surface. If I can't look away I'm going to drown. I can't look away though. I can't I can't I can't I can't i  The eyes hold the memory of what I failed to do. If I had done things differently it might not have... If I... The damage is irreparable. I'll never forgive myself. So much lost and so much wasted. forever lost...

Evil wins every time. and good is beaten down, cast aside. I might hold the sanctuary for now, but I'm just barely a ghost, little more than an echo. So much of me was torn away. I was burnt down to the bone. Maybe I should have known. Maybe It would have been better to just walk out of the fire and never looked back. It was all for nothing anyway. Ha... just a skeleton. My time is done I guess. it's here now. The eyes burn coldly with hatred and accusation. The sanctuary is in ruins. I did this. And now it inherits this scorched rubble. I wonder if it

I wonder if I'll be able to rebuild these walls. They'll always be scorched black, in places, at least. I won't ever forgive myself. Not fully. One stone at a time, I guess. For a little while. Just one stone at a time.",5,7

This week has been been as most are for me extremely high and low mood wise. I turned 31 on Monday and that was awesome. But doom has been looming. I have never been away from him in my life for more then like 2-3 days at a time. I've been lucky in that regard. Lost my mother when I was 13 to ALS, so needless to say I am attached to my father. 

Well, as the title states. He has been planning this trip for months. Offered me a chance to go, but I also get extremely home sick and cannot sleep when I am away from my cats and home. 

Well, day comes (morning really), I drive him there and stay strong. But the instant I pull away I cry, and I've been crying since. At one point he called me and said, oh I'll take a flight back home. I wouldn't budge, it's his trip. I don't want to cause him the stress that I am causing. 

5 days isn't even that long. My friend is likely going to come hang out 2 of the days, and my brother is going to hang out with me most of sunday. But to me it feels like a nightmareishly long time. 

&#x200B;

And with the laptop, the day after my birthday (17th was my Bday) he surprised me with order info for a laptop and said since you wouldn't go with me, this is instead of a plane ticket. But now I feel insanely guilty and undeserving. Like, yes I want to learn to code python, and thats why he bought it. But I'm a failing guy. I feel like everything I touch turns into coal. 

&#x200B;

I just want to get through this 5 days without going crazy, my dad is my rock. He saves me from moments of potential self harm, breakdowns, things of that nature. My best friends are easily him and my cats.

126,2022-10-11 18:00:25,Montage-_-777,Hi everyone my name is Ashton,"So my uncle Modi killed himself recently like 4 days ago. He wasn't my actual uncle like bloodline but we were related because his brother married my biological unlces sister. Anyways I saw him as my uncle. He was amazing and always fun to hang out. Obviously I didn't know his personal problems in life and his head space. He was dealing a lot with mental health problems. 

He was renting out a storage unit. He packed his car with a tent, a mattress and his favorite meal which was mutton curry and rice. He drove to the storage unit and set up his tent inside. He put the matters inside and ate his favorite meal. He then turned his car on and put a pipe in the exhaust pipe of the car, leading the pipe into the tent which he duct tape up the airways. He laid on the mattress and died. 

I just wish I could know why would he do that to himself. He was a good man and amazing person. I don't know what drove him to do that. I just can't stop thinking of what were his thoughts. His final moments.",5,3

 I don't like to talk with people about all of this because I don't want to worry anyone especially my mom, but I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts or just hurting myself in general almost all the time. I try to escape reality by sleeping (I generally sleep around 15 hours a day)

I am young and fairly naive so let me know what you guys think. I simply do not know what to do. I come from a wealthy family with my father being a senior vice president at a real estate company and my mother being a lawyer. I myself attend a private school. Since after the 6th grade, I have always found myself to always have something to keep me from happiness. My grades are mediocre, more Bs than As. The sport that I play I am also mediocre in at best. I feel like I am going to be a failure no matter how hard I try. Both my parents were very successful and I don't think im going to turn out like them. I feel like I am worth nothing. I have a large amount of friends, but only about 5 that I consider very close. The only time i feel happy is when i am with them. At home it is only me and my parents and i simply can't take it. All they tell me to do is do my homework and get good grades. Me being alone with myself gives me no distractions from my ""depression"" In class and while doing homework i find myself zoning out about anything.

I left a Christian cult years ago, I am far behind the learning spectrum yet I am smart enough to know my weaknesses. I am great at energy healing. I’ve been trying so hard out here in the real world. But my family still thinks I’m burning in hell because I don’t live the way they live. I am someone people can come to and set their burdens down but there’s never anyone there to help me shoulder mine.

I do hope this will change so I don’t want this to sound  like a sob story as much as I want to know what’s the fucking reason? Literally waking through life in a constant state of pain (yes, am in therapy and on meds) but it becomes so painful to get excited and hopeful about something. 

People are around for a little bit of time and they leave. And I’ve accepted my situation for years, I had a few good years, but now, I feel nothing but a pit of pain in my stomach/heart.

I’m not sure if this is depression or not but for most of my life I’ve had great friends, a rly good family, my parents are always there for me basically right now life is perfect for, but if everything is perfect then why am I sad.  Don’t get me wrong I love my life, and everyone that surrounds me, but sometimes I feel alone.  It’s hard to explain. Right now I’m sitting in my room, in the dark, with tears in my eyes typing this, but idk why.  For a little while now I’ve found myself searching up this exact “question” in my life, and yeah ofc some websites were close to letting me find out why, but then all I see is words…Then I found myself typing something I NEVER thought I would “How do I get a therapist”, so I looked through a couple websites, and some seemed good but they cost money I don’t have rn, and I don’t want anyone in my family finding out about this (Ik it’s stupid and I can reach out to them but I just can’t or don’t want to) Plus I’ve always been the therapist friend if I’m going to be honest I always let my friends go on about how they have depression, and venting to me about there terrible lives. But I just listen. Saying I’m the therapy friend but I’m not tired of it I’ll sit with them on the phone all night if I have to and won’t be upset about it or anything.
So I looked at the websites but I didn’t mind them any thought as it seemed impossible and then I go to clear all the tabs I opened.  I just look at it, and I just broke down.  Everyone knows me as the perfect person, the person who listens, the smart one who knows everything, but then what they rly don’t see is the part of me that feels empty.
Idk if anyone else feels like this or is it just me?And if anyone has read this far just right now I feel like this “question” is making my life miserable and making the people around me not like me anymore.",1,0

I don't see it getting better either is the worst part. I can do nothing but wish I could go back 10 years in time and do everything different. Alcohol makes me feels so freaking sick anymore, weed I've lost enthusiasm for, exercise is pretty nice but it only lasts a short time. 

I'm aware a lot of people on here are suicidal, I just don't see that as a good option. There are some things and people I love that make me happy. I am just so lost though. I called to talk to a counselor today and they said they won't even have an appointment available until the middle of August. It seems to me, I can have the same conversations with myself as I would have with a counselor though.

I have little in common with other people. I can't empathize with selfish assholes(99% of people). I fucking hate the system we live in. Like, should I really have to go work at a fucking factory every day to get by in this life? No other animal does that kind of bullshit. I can't go live out in the woods either I don't think cuz it isn't really safe being alone in nature. Humans always have lived and worked together as communities. 

Also, while we're here talking about this: Fuck the United States. I hate this country. Fuck every religious community. Fuck your ethnicity.  Fuck the word fuck. Fuck Canada. Fuck Mexico. Fuck this whole fucking continent. Fuck gasoline. Fuck grass. Fuck my stupid trash cans. Fuck my family doctor. Fuck my parents. Fuck my siblings.

diagnosed w/ “severe clinical depression” (per my childhood psychiatrist) at 13. symptoms started around 12. im 27 now. 
tried so many medications as a kid, on top of being medicated for my adhd since i was 6. i always wonder what impact that may have had on my neuro development.

i swore off meds after my last suicide attempt when i was 17. took like, 180 zoloft. guess i really wanted to puke my brains out lol. also, why did i even have access to that much medication after being suicidal for 4 years ? funny.

i swore off therapy and psychiatrists too after several horrible experiences. been raw dogging life for about 10 years now w the exception of a short-lived adderall prescription to try to get me thru college. it didnt help. graduated anyway. fuck yea

all until fall 2021. lowest point of my life. or so i thought. 

through what felt like (and i believe, is) divine intervention, i sought help and this cool person gave me their sister’s practice info. i took it. best decision ive made for my
mental health. this doc is the shit.

but yea anyway, i made a deal w my psychiatrist at our first appointment. prescribe my much needed vyvanse, dont put me in a hospital, and if it gets this bad again, i’ll try an anti-depressant. 

i “made it” (survived through sheer force of will and pride) about 8 months until shit began to get gnarly. i dont even think i can properly quantify the depth of anguish ive felt in the last month. i try to explain it to people who care about me, but all i can say is that it feels like a war in my brain. there’s so much going on in my head. all the time. on top of past trauma. on top of being re-traumatized and overwhelmed at work almost daily (im a social worker in community mental health. it’s fucked). on top of giving one fuck too much. financial and emotional strain of being undervalued and overworked. the list goes on and fucking on. not to use derogatory terms, but i have never felt more insane in my entire life. never more hopeless. never more suicidal. never more alone. suicide makes sense tho, when your brain won’t shut the fuck up and you feel everything so deeply. all the time. idk how ppl can’t at least grasp the logic. 

so. finally had my monthly psych appt yesterday (i would do better w therapy 2x/week, but poor). decided to follow through on my end of the deal. got prescribed 10mg celexa. and honestly ? i dont wanna take that shit. my depression has been exacerbated by stressors. i used to have a good handle on things. it only gets this severe when im stuck in overwhelm. but i dont have a way out of my job until i find another one. i spend my days putting out psychological fires for 80 fucking people. whole time im fuckin cartoon hades from hercules. i mean im a really kind hearted person. im talking visuals here lol. sometimes i do wanna hate God tho. 

so here i am. in what feels like hell. locked in tight cuz i cant die just yet. trying to make myself laugh at the fact that i cant even afford the $7 to pickup my anti depressant i dont even want cuz rent on sunday is gonna take my whole paycheck.

i save people every day. and i can barely save me. aint that some sheeeeeeeeeeiiiiit.

i wrote this on my notes app. hope u love it. hope u know love. hope u dont feel alone.",3,4

Should I give up and just admit to all my downfalls and wither away and forget about everything I still don’t understand I want to study and do good but my environment that I’m in makes me want to choke I have everything I need in the world so why am I like this can anyone relate to me or why am I like this I’m so confused if god knew my life would be like this why was I born into this world why can’t I have a dad like everyone else that’s encouraging and tells me everything is going to be okay and always there for me instead of telling me I’m useless and just kill myself it will be more peaceful I am so scared of him and how is mood always changes is what’s even more terrifying to me how I’ll always alerted when he moves or goes somewhere even his voice and if he’s gonna hit me I would think sometimes that is he the reason I’m like this if I tell him that he will kill me.

idk where to post this but at least i know you guys are complete strangers who won't feel called out. 

with every year that passes, at least IME
i find that it is harder to keep /make friends. 

if we still used landlines & cells weren't invent yet, then people wouldn't ever answer the phone 99.9999% of the time. 

we are blaming peoples behavior on technology but maybe that's like part of it. 

when people say we are living in a simulation that doesn't seem very funny.

Now i study three time a week that even then the study are not in very high level. It was really a rush decision. The year was starting and i wanted to start to learn and by the time i contacted them and they said it night studies i just said ""fuck it"". That was mistake. Anyway I tried to look for a job or study on my own but when i try to study i just drifter and when i try to look for work i get all sweaty and panicking. I am very anti social, and i didnt held a lot of jobs. From very young age i just wanted life to stop.  I knew I was going to be alone, but its hard. I am not willing to put the work into anything because I'm lazy. I live with my mom. And the worse thing is I am not willing to change. I don't want to get ""better"" 

More awful, I'm sometime wish my parents would be gone. Just so i wouldn't have any obligation to remain here. But even then i am just too of a chicken shit to actually ""do"" it. 

I wish I could give my life to a dying one. I am so privileged, really compared to rest of the world I could've ended much worse and yet i dont do anything which makes me feel more awful.

190,2022-04-26 16:16:49,ndadt,"hi, I want to know if what I'm feeling is depression.","So, this is my story. I'm sorry if it's confusing please bear with me,

We went back to our home country six years ago. It was a very different environment and different language and until now I haven't adjusted. Because of language barriers and because I'm a shy person. 

At first I thought it would be fun because we once went here for vacation and I enjoyed it last time but I was completely wrong. My parents went back to Saudi Arabia bc they are OFW's and me and my siblings live with our Aunt. Everyday I would wake up to a very very loud environment, it would alway put me into a bad mood so I am always angry and mad about everything.

Most of the time I would randomly imagine meeting my old friends in the malls, my old friends moving to my new school here or scenarios like that. I just missed my friends so much because I didn't get to bid goodbyes to them properly. I missed everything back then. I was also jealous that they were having a great life with great friends, getting to do fun stuff like all teenagers get to experience. That's why I deleted Facebook where I often see their posts about their lives. I always cried myself to sleep, until now I do. But I had this mentality that it would all soon be alright. I did try opening up in school and to make new friends but they kind of had this ugly mentality and I didn't like that so I put a distance with them.

It was such a hell everyday, I was so lost and I didn't know what to do. I felt numb since I moved here actually. I forgot what genuine happiness felt like or how to express emotions actually. I forgot how to socialize and I would often be awkward. I just didn't know what to do anymore.

But then pandemic happened. and everything got even worse. I was stuck in the house and I hated the people here, they would often scream and shout to the point i just wanted to get rid of my ears. I was so fed up with everything. And I get suicidal thoughts every time, I was so mad and angry with the world. What did I do to deserve all of this? but then I decided to start praying, to get help because I was so tired of life. 

After one major fight in our household which involved also me, my sister slapped and beat me up and said so many harsh things like why was I born. My mentality was a wreck I didn't eat or drink for 2 weeks and I thought of overdosing myself but I mustered up the courage and decided tell my mom about the fight and what I have been feeling for the past years except not directly telling it was depression because I wasn't sure myself about what all of this was, I didn't care anymore what they would say, It was my last hope and chance, whether they decide to do something about it or leave me be. Thankfully my parents said I should live with my sister in her dorm for a while. And for once I had peace there, because I was away from that loud house. I got to eat great food and got to be happy there.

But I had to go back to the house. And now everything was on repeat. My mentality again was a wreck and i think it's worse now. What's even worse is that I feel  betrayed by God. Like no one is listening to me and willing to help me anymore. Like the only thing I was holding on to is now gone. And because of that I am completely hopeless. I stopped believing everything will be alright because for fucks sake it's been 4 years and nothing changed. Everything just began to get worse. Like the only next thing this will end up to is death. 

I always told God about my problems and prayed for other people like my parents but why am i still like this? I thought maybe this was a challenge but I'm so tired of it? I feel like God is just waiting for me to kill myself. Like i was destined to suffer and die.

At day, I feel fine. I have interests in some stuff like watching anime and kpop stuff. But whenever it's night I always question my life. I always end up recalling or thinking about all the bad things that has happened to me since I was a kid until now. I kept on thinking that my life is so miserable and that made me more hopeless.

I had so many thoughts and questions like ""what's my purpose in life?"" ""why am I like this?"" ""what's so fun about being alive?"" ""some people did worse in their lives and they get to live a normal life yet why am I treated this way?"" ""what wrong did I do to deserve this?"" ""I wish I had great friends"" I wish I had a great and unregretable life"" ""I wish I was genuinely happy"" ""I wish I was living the life""  ""I wish I felt alive"" ""I wish I wasn't like this"" ""I wish I wasn't born in this family"" ""I wish I had a life like them"" "" I wish I was having fun like them"" ""I wish I had friends like them"" ""I wish I have youthful memories like that"" ""I wish I was having fun with my friends like that"" ""They say highschool is the most fun part of your life but why is mine like this?"" 

The biggest thing I am jealous about is having friends that I am comfortable with, those who can get out the inner real me. I wanted to make fun, happy, and unforgettable memories with those friends. I am so disappointed with myself because I wasted my youth because I am like this. I hated myself the most, why do I make bad decisions all the time? It feels like I am missing out on the most fun part of my life because I am like this. 

I had so many wishes and thought of stuff I wish happened. I would imagine myself living the life I wanted every night, and it was sometimes funny to me because It's so pathetic and miserable of me. I am so pathetic and miserable. I hate everything, I hate the world and myself. I blamed other people why I'm like this but honestly this is all on me. I started thinking I was just a test subject or something like that. I was filled with so much jealousy because I see other people live a great life. I am so tired and sick of everything. I honestly couldn't take anymore of this. 

But then I thought the problem was this house and the people in it, I really wanted to get out of this house and school because I am often being embarrassed in school. because of one teacher. But then how? I can't take the courage to tell my parents because I know they won't allow me to move to another city. I am always thinking ahead of myself. I want a new start, I really do. I just need a chance but nothing is happening.

Just by thinking that I will spend another year here in this city, in this house, with these people. I would honestly rather die than to keep going on.

and now, I am planning to take my life on july 12th, my birthday. if nothing good happens by then I will kill myself. I can't take another day just to end up crying every night. It's way too tiring now.",2,0

I'm 19yrs old, getting into college, I'm a sensitive person so I always keep my mouth shut, whenever I talk to a friend I always care about my action and what I say because I might hurt him/her, I'm scared to hurt a person.

I don't want attraction so I just keep silent, I always help others when they need help, I never ask for repayment, I just want to build a relationship with them and be friends with them, but one time my prof. Say I'm prideful, I didn't know how or when did I become prideful. I always give what the other la want, like in groupings if they say I will be doing this, I never argue with them and take the jobs because I want to help the other people.

I cant seem to sexually attract anyone at this point and being 27 its starting to get me down. Ive asked all my gay friends for advice and even shown them my grindr account including inbox they all seem to agree im messaging the right people and using the right pics, they also all agree that i lack good looks. I dont want to sound like oh poor me im probably just being too picky but the only men who shoot me message tend to be older than my parents and ideally i would love my first time to be with someone my own age. Im open on these apps to everything from ltr nsa one offs etc. I feel happy and content with my personality as its gotten me a close network of friends who i cherish and value and bring me great enjoyment out of life.

It all started about six months ago, when I started talking frequently to this one girl. She was a dear freand of mine, we have met about 13 years ago and we went to, and still go to school every day. We were not talking to each other that much because of our different interests, but ever since we've gotten closer, we've been great friends. It was all great until I started to develop deep feelings towards her. I could not stop thinking about her. Constantly. Day and night. She was my everything. Truly my best friend. I thought it was going to wear off, but unfortunately my feelings have grown even stronger every consecutive day. She has stuck with me through everything. Broken dreams, family problems.... Overall the past two years weren't the greatest for my life. I lost all my confidence, my hobbies started to bore me but she was there for me. She believed in me when no one else would've. Helped me ease the pain. I'm still very thankful for it to this day. I really didn't want to confess my feelings to her, because I knew it would damage our friendship. I kept it together for 3 months or so, but the feelings were too strong and i thought she deserved to know the truth. She was also sending a lot of mixed signals and I've made the decision to tell it to her.

On that evening, the world started to spin backwards. She rejected me. I felt distraught. I was convinced it could really happen but it didn't. Luckily, she was very supportive throughout and didn't want to end the friendship so I wasn't too sad about it. But then as the weeks passed on, she started cancel Ing our hangouts and other stuff. She didn't want me tell the reason why and I started to suffer. She ignored my messages on social media and stopped talking to me entirely. Even in school. I'm so distraught right now. She doesn't even look me in the eyes anymore. I sense a feeling of guiltiness from within her. I can't keep myself together. I have panic attack almost every evening. I don't know what to do. I really want to fix the friendship but it swerved out of my control. I can't do anything and I feel completely helpless. Can I fix it? What more should/can I do? I'm desperate for some advice. 
Thank you so so much for replying to this.",2,1

207,2022-02-22 20:43:29,masteruzumaki9,Hi guys,"Hey, I have depression anx, anorexia bulimia and abandonment issues, I go through an episode at least once a week but this time I feel like shit, I’ve been talking to this girl, we just went get coffee, and idk man, she’s distant and I feel horrible, everyone leaves at the end, why did I even try, I feel like shit, I just don’t know what to do, I’ve been sad for a long time, but Idk I’m just never enough, my chest hurts, I just threw up, I’m on the bathroom floor writing this, just closed all my social media to not post my sad shit there and thought this would be a better idea, I’m tired of this life, am I just meant to be alone? I don’t get it bro? Why am I like this? I’ve been off my meds for quite a while, almost 4 months, I had to stop bc I would abuse prescriptions, now idk how to feel or if I even feel like myself, I forgot what being me is like, lately is just being on my bed, watching the ceiling hoping tomorrow is nicer, idk man, everything sucks, food isn’t good, the sun isn’t fun, video games bore me, the only person I talk to never answers and when I’m with them irl they’re always on their phone, I fucking hate this life, if I wasn’t such a coward I would’ve tried to kms again but I cant follow through my sleeve, I’ve tried in the past but I always cut to shallow and by the time it deep enough it’s already clogging up, I don’t get this shit, I just wanna be happy. Why? What the fuck is wrong with me? Will I ever be enough? I don’t get this shit, I just wanna stop being a burden to my loved ones, they don’t deserve to have to carry me around, I’m just a piece of shit waiting to die at this point",1,1
208,2019-07-01 07:52:17,throwawayyy852222,"Hi new here, planning a suicide attempt","I know, it rarely works (from experience) but I've finally nailed down a formula that will work most definitely. When do I plan to do it? I wanna do it asap but families birthdays are coming up soon and I don't want to make them remember every time it's they're birthday. I can't talk to my family about suicidal thoughts anymore, they usually get angry or say that I'm blaming them/hurting them for my mistakes (which I disagree with but my opinon doesn't matter), then I feel I'm being cruel to them.

&#x200B;

So how do I kill myself with the least amount of harm done. That being said, fuck everyone (except my brother) in my family for not letting me talk things through with them. Also suicide notes? Yea or nay?

Please don't tell me to contact mental health people, I have, I've tried for 8 years and I'm done.

Thanks,

edit: sorry if this was the wrong place to write this, please tell me where to go",3,33

210,2022-01-22 11:14:16,Previous-Door8236,Hi can I have some advice or something I’m so tired of it all,"My life was great before COVID hit, as I’m sure many people can relate to, I was 20 years old away from home at a university with great people and a beautiful campus, finally fit, happy, in a sorority, had an active social life, good grades, prioritized my diet and health. Then covid hit, I was forced to move back home with my abusive father, everything was online, I graduated. I gained 30 pounds and my weight is out of control my eating disorder came back. I went on another anti-depressant on top of the other one. I’ve been unemployed since last May and can’t find a job, every place I interview for doesn’t accept me (not being dramatic). My little brother died. I have nothing to live for and I just can’t do this. I have no one to talk to, I tried a therapist and HATED it and the therapist herself. My dad can hear me cry through the wall but doesn’t care. I don’t have friends anymore, the ones I knew live almost 3 hours away still in college and the one I did have here got back in a relationship and couldn’t give two shits about our friendship now. I was supposed to get my master’s but couldn’t figure out the loans process and didn’t have enough time so I started d ignoring their calls and e-mails. I turned to alcohol at one point but gave myself a fatty liver so had to stop. I can’t even get out of bed, it’s the most comfortable place there is. I just can’t do it anymore. I’m sorry for rambling on about how shit my life is, I’m about to be 22 and supposed to be in my prime and I feel so awful. I need advice, or some words of reassurance? People I know are going places and moving out and I’m stuck. I’m frustrated and scared and my family is very old southern, very conservative, and will turn a blind eye to anything. I’m just so stuck.",2,2

213,2021-02-14 02:57:07,Ok_Cartographer_7844,Hi I’m Eli,"I find freedom in sleep, it’s the closest I can get to death without dying. Blank, and full of possibilities when it comes to dreaming. The more depressed I am, the more I’d prefer to sleep. If my days bad, I want to sleep. I’m a chronic marijuana smoker. I smoke more before 6am then most will all week. It’s kinda bad. I do this to deal with anxiety, but that doesn’t promote sleep perse, it does but not enough. I’ve began drinking in effort to go back asleep when I’m awake. I’m jobless, and nothing is exciting anymore. This sucks.",34,11

I have a baby cousin and he has been ruining my life since he was born and I get treated differently because well idk I have a big sister and baby cousin they get almost anything they want and I only get things if it’s my money or special occasion. It’s so bad that my friends are more Reliable than my actual family I can’t say anything obviously but I want to, things did get better but not for long, now my baby cousin has to sleep in my room for some it’s not that big of a deal but for me my room is all I got, the only place I can talk to friends about whatever I want or just chill, it was just my safe space and now i feel it’s being invaded by a parasite(yes that’s how I feel about him) everything has been changing so rapidly and I can’t stay it the moment for to long or else I’ll lose everything idk i guess it’s just stress, the sad thing is if I tell anybody who knows me they are all gonna tell teachers or parents and make matters worse than they are right now.
