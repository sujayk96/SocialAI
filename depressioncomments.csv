1,WilderKat,"I’m so sorry you are suffering depression and pain. That’s a lot to deal with and it’s great you are reaching out for help.

I don’t tolerate anesthesia or Vicodin well. Anesthesia causes me extreme nausea and Vicodin gives me horrible headaches- I would not take it again. My ketamine doctor gives me Zofran and I’ve never been nauseous.

I don’t know which treatment you are looking into. There is treatment for depression/anxiety/PTSD which is about an hour and then there is treatment for chronic pain which I believe is 4 hours. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong.

For me, I started low dose because I’m super sensitive to meds. I did two treatments before increasing. 

It is not a straight path to nirvana so to speak. There are peaks and valleys, but it gets better. An integration therapist is key. Journal and observe without judgment.

Research the facilities and find a doctor will to talk to you about your concerns. My doctor talked for a half an hour for free and answered my questions. If you aren’t able to do the research because it’s to mentally taxing, have a friend or family member help you.

Ketamine provides objective distance from your mental health issues. It will work even if you don’t disassociate. 

I look at it as an investment in me. If someone said I had a kidney problem, I would fix it, but I feel the brain gets neglected because we believe we can think our way out of depression. 

Find a good facility that makes you feel comfortable and safe and supports you.

It’s scary, but honestly it’s been a wondrous journey for me. In my disassociation, I’ve experienced another world filled with possibilities I never knew existed.

I wish you a healing journey and hope you feel better. You deserve help and a fulfilling life. Please feel free to ask me questions if you have any. Best wishes.",1643605174,huyfp50,/r/TherapeuticKetamine/comments/sgoe94/starting_out_advice/huyfp50/,TherapeuticKetamine,1643623174.0,"{'author': 'WilderKat', 'body': 'I’m so sorry you are suffering depression and pain.

3,Randilion8,"&gt;Weird how men are usually satisfied with a woman who isnt too fat and isnt a total cunt..and as long as she has a vagina and tits, he is 100% satisfied with her.

If this was the case, because I have both, AND I'm a good woman who stood by my man in his darkest times, but in my dark times (after I moved away from my family and friends to start fresh with him, after only 3 months into our new home and his amazing job he decided to fuck a Dunkin whore). See? Men can be dicks too. I gave him all of me, anytime he wanted, but he wasn't satisfied because it wasnt the same attention and love that I first gave him (and he didn't give me the same either, that just happens after you've been with someone a long time). And according to him, I'm the best he's ever had... So, I can debunk your theory right there simply from my own life experience but I'm also not naive to think that you probably haven't been through the same thing. 

And just a side note: we are still together. Because I know drugs and depression played a part in it. It's been 2 years since I've found out and I'm STILL fucked up over it. It has completely ruined my confidence and self esteem and I can't trust my judgement but I know deep down he's a good man and I can only pray that he sees what he risked by being so foolish. These days, no one is satisfied. Not when you have women who knowingly fuck with a man that has a significant other (I read every text between them - he told her I was a good woman and didn't deserve it and she wasn't sympathetic at all, basically begged him for his dick ""one last time"" and that was in the beginning of 2019 and they didn't stop sleeping together until August of same year), she only cared about herself. Not the family she was ultimately destroying that we worked HARD to build from the ground up. She should have realized she was an easy piece of ass since he literally only came to her when he needed a nut. People are awful. Most people suck. But I know who he is deep down and I would be a hypocrite if I didn't give him a second chance after all the chances I've been given in life when I didn't deserve it. You have to learn and grow from your mistakes. I know me simply telling you this won't change your mind, but hopefully it helps you see that all humans can fall short sometimes. Some change. Some don't. Those who don't, don't deserve a spot in your life. Those who do, and prove it, well, I say they are just normal people who make bad choices just like everyone else.",1643605154,huyfntv,/r/opiates/comments/sfiis1/mini_rant_dating/huyfntv/,opiates,1643623154.0,"{'author': 'Randilion8', 'body': '&gt;Weird how men are usually satisfied with a woman who isnt too fat and isnt a total cunt..and as long as she has a vagina and tits, he is 100% satisfied with her.\n\nIf this was the case, because I have both, AND I\'m a good woman who stood by my man in his darkest times, but in my dark times (after I moved away from my family and friends to start fresh with him, after only 3 months into our new home and his amazing job he decided to fuck a Dunkin whore).

Since I was 16, I opened my eyes to who my mother truly was. I(18f) am tired of all her bs, to me and my sister(25f) she's been a complete A, mostly to her, complaining of her not working enough or ""making a life"" when she pulls her back from it. My sister practically raised me and my brother and suffered the most of us three, being abused physically by my mother, at the time I didn't see it due to being a child. She's affected our lives so many times, moving from the US to my country and back and forth damaging my education and my brothers. My sister is the world to me even if sometimes she's a pain with her attitude but that's her personality and I don't blame her, it's too much stress from my mom. She's so toxic and always complaining to both of us, but my brother (14m)? She treats him like a king and doesn't care if he disrespect us, he even hit us and she doesn't do anything! He's always in his room playing videogames while my sister and I are the ones being called ""lazy"" when we do almost everything.

Due to college, my stress levels are so high I daily have breakdowns and have insomnia, my sister has really bad health problems and mostly from having a stroke only being 21 as well having heart problems, but does my mom care? No! Not even when we're sick. We've always done everything for her, tried our best to be the best daughters but only complains and makes us feel like crap and we even suffer from depression because of her. We've talked to family members and even my mom's best friend about it but they can't do anything. I can't leave my home because if my sister leaves, I have to stay for my brother, kinda unfair, right? But she's staying for us so I can't complain. I'm afraid of my mother because I know what she's capable of, she even ignored, blocked and talked crap about my sister just because she moved out of the house in the past!

I've talked to my mom before of what I felt, an example is when she got back AGAIN with my stepdad when she promised AGAIN she wouldn't bring him in our lives, even his dad said that to her! HIS DAD! But she only said that I didn't care about her happiness and I was being selfish and ignorant for feeling uncomfortable with him here. Yes, he's nice and all but there's times he gets in my nerves and is sexist, toxic and even homophobic at times! Just like my mom! And selfish as well. He's been in our lives for 9 years, the same thing happening again and again, break up, go back, kick us out to the streets, gets back, both cheat, get back, they even wanna get married! But to not make this longer, I'm afraid of telling her what I truly feel, AITS for not speaking up? Am I just too much of a coward?
