We are allowing posts of this nature from individuals in sincere distress because we know that the political climate can impact our emotions, worldview, and hopes for the future.

We are taking all possible steps to prevent abuse, but if you receive any kind of trolling or guideline-breaking response to a post or comment you've made here, whether it mentions politics in any way or not, please let us know and we'll be on it as soon as we can.

We know that for some of you tonight might feel like the last straw. It's completely understandable that you'd want help, but the wide-open internet is not the place to seek it right now.

Please seek mental-health support through true crisis resources, which we are not. The sidebar/community info has links if you need them.

Welcome to the weekly post where we can all take a moment to check in or share how we are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about, or are having a tough time but don’t feel you can make a post, this is a place you can talk. 

&nbsp;

Please remember to follow the subreddit rules and **report** any rule violations that you see. The subreddit rules can be found on the [sidebar](/r/depression/about/sidebar). If you aren't sure about a rule, please [check with us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression).

It has certainly been a very busy time as of late around here, and time seems to be going by very quickly. If anyone has been stealing my time, please return it after the meeting. You can leave it anonymously, no questions asked. >.> 

Anyway! We've had people asking about the possibility of weekly posts to act as community building spaces where anyone can talk and share. This would be a big change, and one that is not necessary for the safety of those posting here, meaning we want to know what *you* think. 


There are a few questions that we need to figure out which I'll list below. How you answer is up to you - you can comment, or fill out the survey. **Edit: We have closed the survey at this time and are looking at the results**The survey is very short and is via Survey Monkey. It does not require any log in information and does not record IP addresses (I specifically checked. Privacy is *very* important). 

So, what do we want to know from you?

&nbsp;

**Do you want an official weekly post?**

If we do a weekly post, what is it going to be focused on? We have a few ideas that have been suggested already (that we think could be cool), but feel free to add ideas or just tell us what you think of these. 

- A post where people can check in with how they're doing

- A post for people to talk about progress or milestones reaches

- A post where people can show off things they've created or made. 

&nbsp;

Ultimately, we want to know what you would find helpful about an official weekly post, and what your concerns with this are. This is  a decision we want to make not just on a vote basis, but also with an understanding of how it would help people and with an eye to any unintended impact it may have on those struggling.

Right now the mod team is looking at the survey results and comments made anonymously, along with the comments here and talking about what comes next.

This is something that has no involvement from the mod team - we have only just now become aware of it. The individual is asking for personal information that is *more than enough* to identify you. 

We always caution people to be aware of privacy concerns when posting. Some of you only post here from a certain account. This sign up is asking people for their **username**, **real name**, and **address**. With those three pieces of information is is entirely possible for them to violate your privacy in many ways - up to and including calling the police. 

That is not to say that this is what the information *is* being used for. We do not know the intentions of the individual who set up the Secret Santa (we're working on that). What we do know is that we have a responsibility to you all when it comes to keeping this subreddit a safe place to talk.

44,44,2015-10-18 14:29:29,"We some of you may recall, we've spoken out against bots or other automated ways of offering support to people at risk for suicide. Our feelings on this haven’t changed.

&nbsp;

What seems to help at-risk people most is a real person who gives the gift of understanding. We appreciate the people who help our OPs more than we can say, and we want to make sure that they have all the information they need. Increasingly, though (possibly due to increasing app use), our helpers aren’t always seeing the information in the sidebar, and getting themselves into difficulty as a result. 

&nbsp;


So we’ve decided to try out using automoderator to identify the first time someone comments on another person's post, and generate an informational message which they will only receive once.  The text of this message is at the bottom of this post. 

&nbsp;

Even though OPs who don't comment on others' posts will *never* receive this message, we've added a boldface reassurance for anyone who's here primarily because they need support.

&nbsp;

This automatic message will also help us with another problem we're having: a self-appointed vigilante who's been abusing some of our helpers. So, another thing the automated message will do is make sure that everyone who helps out here is forewarned about these messages and knows not to take them seriously, because the interpretation of our rules is so superficial and literal that it goes *against* our intent most of the time.  

&nbsp;

We will keep a close eye on how things go in the sub, and, as always, we're anxious to hear your feedback.  The full text of the message is below:

&nbsp;

>Subject: Thanks for responding in /r/suicidewatch


>Hi, /u/{{author}},

>Because we appreciate everyone who supports our OPs, the SW mod team would like to share some information that may be helpful to you. (This message *goes out once to everyone* who replies to someone else's post here after October 18, 2015 when we implemented the new automoderator logic.)  
               
>**If your main reason for being here is to** ***get*** **support for yourself, the main rule you need to pay attention to is that we can't allow explicit discussion of suicide** ***methods.*** **Otherwise, you're free to ask for help and express your feelings in whatever way is easiest for you, and you don't need to read any more of this message.**
                        
>As most responses here are in support of someone suicidal, we'd like to draw your attention to the guidelines in [our sidebar](/r/{{subreddit}}/about/sidebar).  Please read them, as some of our policies can be a bit surprising.  For example, we strongly discourage PMs as a first resort, or any kind of ""it gets better"" message for excellent reasons, which are fully discussed in the posts linked from section 4 of our guidelines. We also strongly encourage you to read [our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87), which are based on the best evidence-based model of the suicidal mindset available.    
                     
>We also want to give you a warning that we're currently having trouble with a self-appointed vigilante who sometimes responds to well-intended helpers with abusive PMs.  Please [send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SuicideWatch) if this happens to you, and please **ignore** any feedback on your responses unless you're sure it comes from a member of the SW mod team.

45,45,2015-08-18 00:30:33,"I have been thinking about posting something for, quite honestly, months now. The main reason that it has taken so long for me to put something out here has been because I simply haven’t had the strength or courage to do so. Talking about my problems is really hard because when you talk about them or write them down that makes them real. I have therapy every week which is really helpful but there is just so much to cover and I end up so exhausted in every way possible that I feel I’ll never get through this. 

   . 


Right now I’m on my second draft of this post and I’m still trying really hard not to cry. The easy excuse for near tears would be how much physical pain I’m in (patches of my skin are burning because they can right now and my bones are joining in, yay fibromyalgia), but honestly I’m used to physical pain. That is so much easier to deal with in the short term. 

.

The real reason I’m near tears is because it feels like my life is simultaneously dragging me along at a million miles an hour and deteriorating. My relationships are falling to pieces, including my marriage, I am barely making it through each day with the amount I have to do, and I am so fucking tired. 

.

I keep on pushing through all of the crap that life/the universe/whatever throws at me but I’m just… I don’t know how to do this anymore. Everyone around me seems so sure that I am on an upward trend and am doing really well while I’m drowning.

46,46,2014-09-12 21:51:16,"Hello all!

Lately we’ve been noticing a serious increase in the number of people inviting PMs, posting identifying information (this includes usernames on other social media sites) and generally not following the [rule regarding keeping conversations *public* unless the OP asks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)

***


So, why are we so adamant about enforcing these rules? What’s the big deal about moving conversations to PM anyway? Well, there are risks on both sides. 

**For the poster/person in distress** – there is no one to point out if you are being given bad or dangerous advice. Having multiple people comment, or even just able to read the conversation can make a big difference. When the conversation stays on the subreddit, we’re able to step in if needed. People with questionable motives are more likely to want to move to PM, since then no one can point out their inappropriate behavior or contradict them. 

**For the people commenting** – When you move to PM there can be an expectation that you will make everything better. That is an *enormous* pressure to put on a single person. Even hotline responders have people with them helping to back them up and keep them level headed. Keeping things out in the open means sharing the responsibility and letting others step in as needed. 

**For everyone** - Posting information regarding other social media accounts (your skype username, telephone number, etc) is ***not allowed*** by our subreddit or by Reddit itself. We will remove all posts that do this. 

‘But skyqween, these risks are okay with me. **Why else would I bother keeping my discussion out in the open?**’ Great question! Having your conversation visible to others isn’t just about risk management (though that is the main reason). The [90/10/1](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/) rule of the internet says that for every person posting in distress, there are roughly nine more lurking and reading the supportive comments because they aren’t comfortable making a post themselves. So, when you keep your conversation visible to others you’re also *helping others to feel less alone and misunderstood.*

##This is the bottom line:

If you are a poster in distress, we very much hope that you will choose to have a conversation out in the open. However, we recognize that some are not comfortable with this. If you’re not comfortable posting publicly there are alternatives to simply making a post asking for PMs. You are always welcome to message the mods and talk to us privately. Another avenue you might want to explore is choosing someone who has a good track record in the community that you feel comfortable talking to and messaging *them* directly. However, at the end of the day if you are a poster and feel that you must post asking for a private conversation we understand. Please just be aware of the risks going forward. 

##If you are a commenter and want to ask people to pm you despite all this – don’t. We will remove the posts when they are brought to our attention and when we find them.

49,49,2013-08-24 22:25:59,"Hey all!

Lately we mods have noticed an upswing in certain rules being broken. Specifically, people have been soliciting PMs from posters straight away much more often. :( We've also been seeing an upswing of 'just get over it' or 'just choose to be happy' type responses. Both of these types of replies are not allowed, and we need your help in getting things back on track.

So what can you do to help? First off, don't break the rules! Check out the [talking tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/) if you're not sure what to say or how to say it, and click the report button on any comment that you see that breaks the rules. It’s also very important that you don’t report things simply because they’re high risk. That makes them less likely to be seen by the community because the spam filter is prone to eating them. If you see something high risk that you’re worried is too extreme to be posted, go ahead and message us about it, including a link to the post that worries you!

I know what you're going to say - 'But mods, I'm already awesome, and I already follow the rules and report rule breakers. So what else is there to do?' Well, you can always look for posts that have no responses yet and talk to them. Check out the new section for people who haven't gotten any support yet.

But what about when you want to share some cool thing you’ve found - You’ve started a blog, or found a great youtube channel, or stumbled upon a cool comic that you think everyone here should see. Cool. Keep in mind that we have some very strict rules about sharing links here. Any link is going to have to be accompanied by text that fully explains the value of the site you’re sending us to. That doesn’t mean copying and pasting something from the site, or just a sentence or two, but actually explaining it. We are real sticklers about this one, because we don’t want people using this as a place to drive up page views or to ask for money. There are other subreddits for that.

What's that? You're so amazing that you even already do that? And you've got a great idea that might help the subreddit? Why not tell us about it here? Or via the mod mail? We'll talk with you about it and consider it!

Before you start brainstorming below; here are a few things that we have already considered at great length and already have positions on:

IRC Channel/Chat room – Not happening, sorry. There’s one floating out there, it isn’t ours, never will be. We don’t run it, don’t associate with it, and have no control over what happens there. Those things are nearly impossible to moderate and keep as safe spaces, and we’ve got our hands full here.

Removing the Downvote Button – We can’t actually do this. All we can do is hide it, and hiding it is something that can be circumvented so easily, doing so isn’t something that we feel will actually benefit the community. However; if the admins ever find a way to disable the downvote capability completely, we will revisit this.

Anything you want to talk about we haven't touched on? Cool! Big ideas? Let's hear them! Confused? Let us know and we'll clear it up! ",0.5389272570610046

I miss my eyebrows. I miss the two little wrinkles in between them that used to show up when I frown. It's my face, but not my expressions any longer. 

And to top it off, when I get the ability to move them back again because the botox has worn off, it'll be time for a new treatment to stop my migraines again.

51,51,2013-04-26 14:05:49,"At the request of the community, and after grappling with similar issues over in /r/suicidewatch, we have decided that posts in which the main message is 'I care', 'I love you', or 'it will get better', are no longer allowed. 

The reason behind the rule change is explained in depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cep2h/psa_whats_wrong_with_posting_a_general_people/) but the basic reasoning below. 


A message that in any way tries to tell or show the suicidal (or depressed) person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”. People suffering from depression often have trouble with feeling detached or alienated, and these sorts of posts can often serve to only increase those feelings. 

It is at the request of many members of this community that we have instituted this rule change here as well as on /r/suicidewatch. If you want to make a post but are not sure if it will violate this new rule, *ask* and we will happily take a look for you.

52,52,2013-03-11 16:40:14,"As there have been more posts lately about how the subreddit is being run and about what changes should be made, we’ve decided that it would be a good time to discuss what *we're* discussing and get some feedback. This is going to cover a lot of varied topics, including some potential changes, and an opportunity for random suggestions to be made. 

Before we get to the fun stuff - a few reminders. 

**Reminder One** 

We are **not** a hotline and cannot guarentee an answer to every post or a timely response. Sometimes it gets quiet here, sometimes a post gets buried, and sometimes we mods have to sleep. (We're working on fixing the sleep bug so that it will no longer interrupt our work. Bear with us.) 

**Reminder Two** 

Moving discussions to pm is not something we recommend for multiple reasons. We have a lot of lurkers here that read what others post and are helped by replies to things they haven't posted. In addition, keeping things out in the open so to speak gives others a chance to chime in, to see new points of view that may help them, and takes the pressure off of people trying to help. *Even the professionals at suicide hotlines do not handle phone calls by themselves. They always have someone there to support them and offer input.* 

**Reminder Three** 

Please read the sidebar before you post. It has all sorts of cool stuff in it, and we've worked really hard on it. A lot of the things that we have to remove could stay up if the poster had read the rules and made a few small changes. 

**CHANGES WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING**

Right now we are talking about how we can improve the subreddit and take advantage of some of reddit’s cool features. We would love to know what you think/if you have any ideas about how we can do this. 

1. Flair. We're talking about it. What kind of flair would *you* find helpful? What would be unhelpful? Do we need flair at all? 

2. Self-posts only. We're considering turning the community into a self-post only subreddit. Links would still be allowed - BUT they would have to be in a self post with text accompanying them that explains the link. Things like 'Click here' wouldn't count, but explaining why you found it helpful and then linking would be. What do you all think? 


3. As you may know, reddit is now using wiki pages. What sort of things do you think would be helpful on ours? Do you have something cool we could use? 

**THINGS WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND WILL NOT BE DOING**

These are less fun, but we thought we would preemptively explain why some suggestions just aren't going to happen. 

The downvote button stays - we can't actually remove it, but we have the ability to hide if. However, it is very easy for people to get around this change and continue to downvote despite the change. If the admins give us a way to truly disable the button instead of hiding it, we will revisit this. 

We will not be setting up an IRC channel, a message board, a chat room, or anything of the sort. We've got our hands full here, and don't have the ability or the time to moderate them properly. Any such thing that shows up is going to have no moderation or an entirely different mod team - please keep that in mind if you find one and decide to visit it. 


**YOUR TURN!**

Now that all of the serious stuff is out of the way - what do you want to see in this community? Is there a change that you think would be good to make? Do you have a suggestion? Now is a great time to let us know!

I also do cross stitch (badly) and have finished two pieces so far, and love to read. I've got all seven Harry Potter audio books on my phone and listen to them every night, and am often buried in a book when work gets slow. 

Some random facts about me, since talking about myself is hard... 

I have been around the world, to over 16 countries, and only need to get to Antarctica to have hit all 7 continents. 

I was really good at Speech in high school, and can talk without saying anything really well. 

I write - poetry and prose, when the mood strikes.

I love animals, and spent a year volunteering at a no kill shelter.

For the record - can't eat corn. No popcorn, corn corn, corn syrup, corn starch, nothing. Get a migraine within 20-30 minutes if I do. Every. Single. Time. No, I don't know what exactly in it I react to. Just that I do. Think lactose intolerant, but worse. Nothing to do for it. 


TL;DR - I can't have anything in the house, and I hate craving the things I can't have. ",0.580016553401947

I just needed to say this - Fuck you. I'm not depressed because I don't have god in my life. I'm depressed because my brain doesn't balance chemicals right. If I relied on prayer and 'the lord' to save me, I would have killed myself years ago. 

So stop telling me I'm going to go to hell, stop telling me that if I just accept Jesus I'll feel better, stop acting as though I did something wrong. Just. Stop. ",0.5576658248901367
62,62,2012-02-19 23:22:09,"Hey guys, 

This week has been especially hard on me. I just moved, haven't gotten settled, and am pretty sure I lost one of my best friends that I've known/been friends with since pre-k. 

I've been depressed for years, and usually I've got a pretty good handle on it. I take my medication, stay active, and function well for the most part. But right now I am just so incredibly discouraged. I've watched so many people walk away from me because of who I am, and because of my depression. I feel very isolated even when in the same room as people I love, and can't help but wonder who I'm going to lose next...

I think that about sums up the ramble...

Edit - Going to go try sleeping. If I don't reply that's prolly what I'm doing...",0.5741917490959167

I'm pretty sure I know where I'm getting it - but I really need help with getting the visuals locked in and the placement worked out. I have to love it, and it has to be just right, which is why I'm working on it so far in advance. 

I have the key - I can provide a picture of it if needed. I'm up for putting in a bit of color or something, but I have no idea what to put into it.

I'm having flashbacks to a much darker time when I was making near constant suicide attempts/gestures. Since I don't really know what to do to snap out of it... I guess I'm looking for some pick-me-up type stuff. 

I probably won't respond tonight... Since I need to sleep or it'll get worse. :( That said, one of the things that does make me feel better is sharing my poetry. 

The poem I'm sharing is one I wrote when I was in the hospital at my own request after trying some dumb things.... It is what it is. 




“The Bridge”


girders of rusted steel and bird shit

shaking from those going about their lives

trembling from responsibility

one step, then two

each one closer to the center

where one lonely sign sits


one small sign

sitting pretty 

on the post heels kiss 

worn metal craning to admire 

the last thing so many lost 

souls saw 

cold bites and tugs

urging

numbed minds to

take the plunge

90,90,2010-10-15 22:32:14,"Reddit, I need your help. I am corn intolerant, and as such cannot eat anything with corn in it without becoming sick, which includes things such as corn starch, high fructose corn syrup, etc. 

However, I cannot find every name that HFCS and the like go by. I know that HFCS can also be called maize syrup (Which is easy to spot) but also glucose-fructose in the UK, and glucose/fructose in canada. 

Are there any other names I need to watch out for? Can something labeled simply 'fructose' or 'glucose' be corn based or derived of corn? 

I'm rather sensitive to corn (a single soda will make me ill if it's not diet), but I can't find anywhere what I need to know about label regulations in this aspect. So reddit, I turn to you. Please help me stay away from stuff that makes me sick!",0.5601025819778442
